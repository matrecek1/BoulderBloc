# BoulderBloc REST API

You can create, list, update and rate climbing Gyms, specific walls in the gyms and boulders that are on the walls.

## How to use?

The API is Work in progress, so it isnt deployed yet. But I plan to deploy it probably on AWS api gateway.

## Whats next?

I still have some features I need to implement in the API, and when its done I want to create a SPA that will display the data from the API, for that I will probably use React.js.
